        <h1>Life in 2021</h1>
        <p>
            Where do I start? So many talking points to start from. I assume the easiest way to start is to talk about my goals and ambitions for 2021 after having such a great 2020.
            When entering 2021 I had the perfect idea or image of how great this year was going to be and how I'm going to make 2021 better than 2020 since I had found such great success,
            that great success was...
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>displine</li>
            <li>consinstency</li>
            <li>confident</li>
            <li>focused</li>
            <li>goals set, and accomplished</li>
            <li>Eating better</li>
            <li>No regrets left</li>
            <li>Learned how to express my emotions through pen and paper</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All that was achieved were goals I had never set for myself which is suprising I didn't expect anything out of 2020, no expectations at all! Just pure hard work, and doing what I love.
            Which was soccer and it's quite incrediable how I took a dark and lonely time, were everyone is stuck inside their houses and I'm out grinding, with friends that I got to achieve some
            vital success with. I was looking for a similiar simply because of those reasons and the fact of where I was mentally at the beggining of 2020; very down, negative, failing classes, etc.
            So with that said I didn't want a start the year of in that way. I wanted to start it off strong both mentally , spirtually, and physically. As most people you start off strong and then you 
            lightly fade away like a feather in the wind and lose the real motivation either because you are to lazy, lack of self-motivation, obstacles, plus more. My point is that I was one of those people last year
            or this year whenever your're reading this. (lol) anyways obviously I have more perspective, on the rights, the wrongs, the lessons, the "failures". Now you are probably wondering 
            What goals did he set for himself? Why did it go wrong? Did he give up to easily? Why didn't he seek the sought he saw? Great questions to ask and great replies you will get! :) 
        </p>
        <h2>What goals did he set for himself?</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Not to fail math</li>
            <li>start coding</li>
            <li>Journal everyday</li>
            <li>build healthy relationships</li>
            <li>start a podcast *again</li>
            <li>start a magazine company</li>
            <li>Continue to train everyday</li>
            <li>This list could go on for days.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I mean this list of goals that got accomplised and didn't get accomplished could go on for literial hours. That is how much confidence I grew just from 1 amazing year.
            Seeing most of those goals I did perhapes take a good first step to starting the process and doing all of them, I really did I can say that proudly looking almost a year back.
            I think I can point out the first problem that I was facing was the fact that I thought that I had to be this rare diamond amongest rare diamonds type of person. Little did I know 
            I was only 17 years old at the time, live a little you dumb bitch! Eveything will come to you at the right time; that is very true. Obviously if I just sit around and do nothing then no;
             nothing will find me. Rushing the process is never going to work, but working towards a process will. Small and attainable goals. I see most kids on social media repost "I'm so stressed because I wanna be millionaire by 25."
             although this is an amazing goal, and I wish and hope if this is anyone goal they accomplish it. But then their comes my question of "What are you doing to attain this goal?" and which in most cases
             people aren't doing jack shit to attain this goal and I'm speaking from expierence. I'm not assuming, just speaking basic facts. This isn't a small attainable goal. One quote that sticks with me is 
             "No more expectations just go with the flow and whatever happens, happens." I think this is a great quote because I saw this as a major problem I was assuming, and day dreaming of what a life filled with riches and happiness would look like. The problem with this way of thinking
             is you set unattainable goals that lead you a deadend that you can't get out of. You lose motivation and become a dreamer instead of a doer. Let me connect my 2020 to 2021, in 2020 I went into the year
             with nada,zilch, nil.nothing, 0 expectations. I say this because I was so down and so negative I thought nothing I mean nothing could get better no matter what happened, and then Covid came out of nowhere!
             You would think I was thinking "Oh I'm fucked!" but suprisingly no I was more like "Let's grind some Warzone with the lads!" as time went on and quartine happened and I was grinding Warzone with the boys
             I started creating better habits these habits are the following. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Running</li>
            <li>Healthier eating</li>
            <li>Journaling</li>
            <li>Doing better in school</li> (Mostly because I was cheating)
            <li>Having fun!!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Not to shabby, obviously as time went on the more it got better and better! 
        </p>

        <p>
            In summary just know 2021 was a learning curve to say the least, not how do I make 2022 better?
