        <h1>My goals for 2022? </h1>
        <p>My goals for 2022 are actually very simply and I think at the end of 2021 I'm working towards them slowly. My goals are as followed...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Consistency</li>
            <li>Displine</li>
            <li>Focused</li>
            <li>Learn Html/css/Js/Phython</li>

        <h1>How can I be better?</h1>
        <p>I think the answer is in the pudding on how to I can be better. So to be better I believe that If I do anything opposite of what I did this year it will be just 1% better than this year.
        If I were to stick with my goals, those goals I listed above, it would be a great fucking year. Obviously evrything isn't going to go smooth running, I'm goig to have obstacles to overcome & adapt
        something that I would always say in 2021 and never actually do it. If I were to follow that simple rule; I personally believe any goal I would set for myself would be possible also if I Learn,
        how I learn is by reading books, talking, and listening. This will be a very good year.(LETS FUCKING GO!)   
        </p>

        <h1>How can I make 2022 my year?</h1>
        <p>
            To make 2022 better is to do everything I had said in previous paragraph. You and I have to grow throughout 2022 to feel like we have had a successful year. If we don't grow, we don't learn
            it's that simple. Who ever may be reading this, hopefully you learn something, if you didn't I'm sorry. (I need to get better at writing)
